Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. 
The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), 
and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -


totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf


hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.


Sample Input 1 :

10000 A

Sample Output 1 :

17600


Sample Input 2 :

4567 B

Sample Output 2 :

8762


JAVA CODE:-



    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Write your code here
    float basic,hra,da,pf,totalsal,allow;
    String grade;
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    basic=sc.nextInt();
    grade=sc.next();

    hra=(float) (0.2*basic);
    da=(float) (0.5*basic);
    pf=(float) (0.11*basic);

    switch(grade)
    {
    case "A":allow=1700;
    break;
    case "B":allow=1500;
    break;
    default:
    allow=1300;
    break;
    }
    totalsal = (basic + hra + da + allow- pf);
    System.out.println(Math.round(totalsal));


    }
    }
